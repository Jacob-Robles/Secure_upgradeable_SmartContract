# Secure_upgradeable_SmartContract
Here is a project I created that uses a upgradeable Smart contract with inheritance from a strorage and functional Smart Contract
bult using truffle framework

The Idea is to have a contract that is upgradeable and can keep Funds or data safe while bugs may be discovered and fixed while also 
considering what upgrades may be nessasary for growth
